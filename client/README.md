# FUT - Team - Builder, a Python Django API and React app

My final dev project for the Software Engineering Immersive course, a complex full-stack application built with Django REST Framework and React.

FUT - Team - Builder is a Fifa Ultimate Team clone where users are able to choose from the best football(soccer) players in the English Premier League and add them to their squad. The users are able to make multiple teams and save them to their profile where they, as well as other users, are able to view the teams that have been created.

### Code Installation: 

Clone or download the repo then do the following in Terminal:

Install back-end dependencies: pipenv
Enter Shell for project: pipenv shell
CD into backend folder and run the following:
Make Migrations: python manage.py makemigrations
Migrate: python manage.py migrate
Load Seed data for Formations: python manage.py loaddata formations/seeds.json
MAYBE ADD MORE TEAMS AND LOAD SEEDS FOR TEAMS
Load Seed data for Players: python manage.py loaddata players/seeds.json
Start back-end server: python manage.py runserver
Change into front-end directory: cd client
Install front-end dependencies: yarn
Start front-end server: yarn start

### The Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers.
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
